This is the simple version of the classic tetris game that I built. The blocks, called tetrominoes fall from the top, and the goal is to move and rotate them to form complete lines. WHen a line is completed, it gets destroyed, and you get points.

As the game goes on, the space for the blocks to fall reduces, making it more challenging to play. It includes all 7 classic shapes, smooth controls, and a clean design.
