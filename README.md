This is the simple version of the classic tetris game that I built. The blocks, called tetrominoes fall from the top, and the goal is to move and rotate them to form complete lines. When a line is completed, it gets destroyed, and you get points.
<br>
<br>
As the game goes on, the space for the blocks to fall reduces, making it more challenging to play. It includes all 7 classic shapes, smooth controls, and a clean design.
